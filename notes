git status #all changes i made, all in red

git add . # its when i want to different files
the best thing with git add . is that it adds all the files at once, but if i want to them separately, then i have to them one by one like git add Gemfile or blah blah one by one
 
 git add . puts it in a que to be added to the 
 so that it gets ready to be committed to the github now.

 git commit -m " first commit of mine"

 this is committing files and these are the changes and the msg that will be committed to our files\
 git. still not on github


 git status
 git add .
 git commit -m "first commit"
 git push origin master
